## Overview

**NutriBridge** is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to combat malnutrition and undernutrition in Rwanda by providing equitable access to nutrition knowledge, enabling growth and dietary tracking, and connecting communities with local support systems.

According to UNICEF (2022), nearly one in three children under five suffers from chronic malnutrition in Rwanda. This platform addresses this critical challenge through three core pillars:

1. **Education** - Reliable nutrition knowledge and awareness resources
2. **Monitoring** - Digital tools for tracking growth and dietary diversity
3. **Connection** - Links to local NGOs, health workers, and food suppliers
